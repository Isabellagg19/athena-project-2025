    <p class="subtitle">Have you ever wonder who have been some of the people who through their ideas and actions have made the world what we know today?</p>
    <p class="subtitle">maybe it sounds a little boring but in fact they are awesome people who deserve great recognition, and in this blog you are about to meet them and found out how extrardinary they are  </p>

             <img class="picture" src = "https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/be431f85ac79feccbf2dc12ef2a91986e9db54cb/6c2ee/images/marie-curie.jpg" alt="marie curie"/>
   <p class="names"> Marie Curie </p>
   <p class="subtitle">Can you imagine being a smart and remarkable young girl who is destined to revolutionize science as we know it, but living in a world that doesn't believe that women can do something big and important, very unfair right?</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Well that's exactly what Marie Sklodowska (better known as Marie Curie) lived, she was born in Poland in the year 1867, she was a young girl passionate about science, She loved it so much that she read her dad’s physics books for fun! BUT in her country, girls weren’t allowed to go to university, so Marie secretly studied in an underground school called the "Flying University" (yes, it sounds like Hogwarts). Later she moved to Paris where she met the love of her life a guy named Pierre Curie, they got married, and became the ultimate science power couple</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Together, they discovered two brand-new, glowing elements: polonium (named after Poland!) and radium. These elements were radioactive, which means they released invisible energy — something no one really understood at the time.</p>
    <p class="subtitle">for her tireless work she became the first woman to get a novel in physics, and some time later she became the first person to get a second novel, this time in chemistry!!</p>
    <p class="important">Marie Curie died in 1934 because of the radiation, but her discoveries changed the world — from cancer treatments to nuclear energy — and she opened the door for women in science everywhere.</p>
