   <p class="subtitle">Can you imagine being a smart and remarkable young girl who is destined to revolutionize science as we know it, but living in a world that doesn't believe that women can do something big and important, very unfair right?</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Well that's exactly what Marie Sklodowska (better known as Marie Curie) lived, she was born in Poland in the year 1867, she was a young girl passionate about science, she was basically born a genius BUT in her country, girls weren’t allowed to go to university, so Marie secretly studied in an underground school called the "Flying University" (yes, it sounds like Hogwarts).</p>
    <p class="subtitle"> Later she moved to Paris where she met the love of her life a guy named Pierre Curie, they got married, and became the ultimate science power couple</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Then, here’s the crazy part Marie starts messing with radioactive stuff before anyone even knew what it was. She and Pierre are out there discovering new glowing elements Polonium (named after her homeland, iconic) and Radium.</p>
    <p class="subtitle">for her tireless work She became the first woman EVER to win a Nobel Prize. And then later</p>
    <p class="main">the first human to win TWO. Like TWO. Nobel. Prizes, like such an ICON</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Meanwhile the science boys' club is gagging because she’s out here doing lab work in a dusty shed, lifting barrels, glowing in the dark (literally), and rewriting science. </p>
    <p class="important">Marie Curie died in 1934 because of the radiation, but her discoveries changed the ENTIRE world, from cancer treatments to nuclear energy, and she opened the door for women in science everywhere.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Okay now picture this
    There’s this girl named Malala living her best life in this gorgeous place called Swat Valley in Pakistan, she’s a super smart young girl, always raising her hand in class, and lowkey dreaming of becoming a doctor one day</p>
     <p class="subtitle">BUT THEN This extremist group called the Taliban rolls into town and basically didn't let the girls go to school anymore, like, excuse me?? You want to shut down education for girls?</p>
    <p class="subtitle">But Malala? She was NOT having it, she starts writing a secret blog for the BBC at 11 years old, yes ELEVEN, explaining about how girls were being silenced. She was out here typing the whole truth while everyone else was hiding.</p>
     <p class="subtitle">After that Malala gained popularity, started giving interviews and speeches, with a complete main character energy</p>
    <p class="subtitle"> but the Taliban were not happy about it and tried to assassinate her on her school bus and you'd think that's where the story ends but nope</p>
     <p class="subtitle"> she survived demonstrating her impressive strength and power, later she wrote a book, gave a speech at the United Nations, started the Malala Fund to help girls around the world go to school and then  just casually  became</p>
    <p class="main"> the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner in history at 17 years old. (Yasss Queen)</p>
    <p class="important"> Malala has now become an icon in the battle for women's education and equality, transforming the world in her wake and demonstrating what can be achieved with courage and passion.</p>

    <p class="subtitle"> Okayy, and now the last incredible story of today</p>
    <p class="subtitle"> In Sweden, there was this quiet girl named Greta who was super smart, super observant, and super done with people ignoring the planet literally falling apart.</p>
    <p class="subtitle"> At just 15 years old, Greta starts reading about climate change and start thinking “Wait, if we KNOW the Earth is heating up and people are suffering, why is nobody freaking out?”
    So instead of sitting idly by as many would have done, she started skipping classes every Friday and camped outside Sweden’s parliament with a handmade sign</p>
    <p class="main"> “School Strike for Climate.”</p>
    <p class="subtitle"> she stood up to enyone who questioned her cause (like a total girl boss), and boom media saw her. Then students across the world started joining. It became a full-on global movement: Fridays For Future
      She progressed rapidly until she later showed up at the United Nations to stand in front of world leaders and dropped one of the most savage lines in history:</p>
    <p class="main">“HOW DARE YOU”</p>
    <p class="subtitle"> (She didn’t fly there, btw. She came by zero-emissions sailboat, because yes, she’s that committed)</p>
    <p class="subtitle"> Since that moment until now she has continued doing amazing stuff, like dragging presidents with actual facts and Skipping Davos to protest with other teens.</p>
    <p class="important"> Greta is the perfect example of a Generation Z leader, and with each of her actions she demonstrates exactly how to transform the world.</p>
