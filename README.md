# First athena-project-2025
This is my first project for the Athena Award, it is a website that tells in a fun and different way the story of 3 women who have transformed the world with their revolutionary ideas and incredible achievements, I did it with the purpose that their stories have a wider recognition,so also to motivate other young girls to never stop dreaming and to never stop persisting for their dreams
I made this website in Visual Code Studio, where I used features just like animations, different fonts, tooltips and buttons to make it more dynamic and fun to explore.
